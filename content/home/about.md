# Biography

I received my Ph.D. degree in Psychology under the supervision of [Dr. Eunjoo Kang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eunjoo_Kang) at Kangwon National University in South Korea. During my Ph.D., I examined the neuropsychological mechanism of reward processing during learning in individuals with Internet gaming disorder using functional MRI. 

I joined [Dr. Antonio Strafella](https://twitter.com/APStrafella)'s lab at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health as a postdoctoral fellow in January 2016, with the lab focusing on studying the neuroimaging biomarkers in Parkinson's disease. Particularly, my currently research seeks to assess brain connectivity abnormalities measured by resting-state fMRI as well as PET in Parkinson's disease.
