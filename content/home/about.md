# Biography

I received my Ph.D. degree in Psychology under the supervision of [Dr. Eunjoo Kang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eunjoo_Kang) at Kangwon National University in South Korea. During my Ph.D., I examined the neuropsychological mechanism of reward processing during learning in individuals with Internet gaming disorder using functional MRI.

From January 2016 to October 2019, I was a postdoctoral fellow in [Dr. Antonio Strafella](https://twitter.com/APStrafella)'s lab at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, where I studied neuroimaging biomarkers of Parkinson’s disease. In particular, my postdoctoral research focused on identifying abnormalities in brain connectivity using resting-state fMRI and PET.


I am currently a Research Professor at the Social & Decision Neuroscience Lab, Korea University, directed by [Dr. Hackjin Kim](https://socialdecisionneurosciencelab.org/). My research focuses on the neurobehavioral mechanisms of social evaluation and self-esteem regulation, integrating wearable physiology, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), and neuroimaging approaches.
